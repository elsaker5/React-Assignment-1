Adasa – Photography Blog (React)

Adasa is a simple photography blog built with React where users can browse photography articles and filter blogs by category.

The project was created to practice props, state binding, and client-side routing using React Router, including dynamic blog pages and a 404 not found page.
Blog data is loaded from a static JSON file to simulate a backend response.
